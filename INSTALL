Running Snowy From Your Git Checkout
--
-1. Verify that your checkout is called "snowy" (all lower-case).

0. Install required packages via `pip -r requirement.txt`
    NOTE: recommend using a virtualenv

1. Install system package `python-pkg-resources`
    (package names may be somewhat different from distro to distro. you may
     have luck finding more specific info at http://live.gnome.org/Snowy/Install)

2. Set up your local settings file (in your snowy git checkout):
    cp local_settings.py.in local_settings.py

3. Setup snowy database (in your snowy git checkout):
    python manage.py syncdb

    NOTE: Don't name your admin user 'admin'

4. Start mail debugging server (in your snowy git checkout):
    python manage.py debugmail

    NOTE: This is only needed if Snowy needs to send mails (like in the
    case of user registration) and you don't have an SMTP server set up.

5. Start local snowy (in your snowy git checkout):
    python manage.py runserver

6. Admin your snowy:
    http://localhost:8000/admin

    - In the Sites table, make sure to edit the existing example.com and
    set the domain and name properly, e.g.:

        Domain name:  localhost:8000
        Display name: Snowy

    - In the Consumers table, make sure the 'anyone' consumer is set up:

        Key: anyone
        Secret: anyone
        Status: Accepted
